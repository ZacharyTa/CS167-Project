- (Q1) Fill the following table.

  The parameter values and the accuracy are based on the best model you obtained. The run time is the total run time printed by the program.

  | Parameter     | Value                      |
  | ------------- | -------------------------- |
  | numFeatures   | 2048                       |
  | fitIntercept  | false                      |
  | regParam      | 0.01                       |
  | maxIter       | 15.0                       |
  | threshold     | 0.25                       |
  | tol           | 0.01                       |
  | Test accuracy | 0.8189049167135869         |
  | Run time      | 52.580337541000006 seconds |

- (Q2) Fill the following table.

The parameter values and the accuracy are based on the best model you obtained. The run time is the total run time printed by the program.

| Parameter                              | Value |
| -------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Number of worker nodes in your cluster |       |
| Total number of cores in your cluster  |       |
| numFeatures                            |       |
| fitIntercept                           |       |
| regParam                               |       |
| maxIter                                |       |
| threshold                              |       |
| tol                                    |       |
| Test accuracy                          |       |
| Run time                               |       |

- (Q3) What difference do you notice in terms of the best parameters selected, the accuracy, and the run time between running the program locally and on your Spark cluster having multiple nodes?
